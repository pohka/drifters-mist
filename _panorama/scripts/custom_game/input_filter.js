inputType : val description
---------------------------
pressed : mouse button pressed (0 = left, 1 = right, 2 = middle, ..)
doublepressed : mouse button pressed
wheeled : scroll wheel used (1 = scroll up, -1 = scroll down) 

note: using the scroll wheel will trigger both pressed and wheeled inputTypes. For me scroll wheel is key 5 and 6


Click Behaviors
----------------------
0 = no behavior (clicked anywhere in viewport except for the HUD)
1 = clicked in viewport (this could be an move/attack command)
2 = a click (attack key was pressed before the moused click)
3 = cast ability or item (if an ability hotkey was pressed before the click)

returning true will prevent the default functionality of the mouse input
